# ClimateWins_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Analysis
Analysis of machine learning methods for climate change project

This student project focus on a fictionalized climate change mitigation organization, ClimateWins. ClimateWins is looking to predict the effects of climate change using machine learning models. 
To complete this analysis, I assessed the potential of several machine learning models and optimization methods. The included report, located in the Unsupervised folder, includes the final analysis results.
